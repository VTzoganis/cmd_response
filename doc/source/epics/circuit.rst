.. put a photo of the circuit here

.. tip:: Reduce the background light that reaches the photocell.
   Place the photocell and LED inside a piece of black tubing.
   
   Suggestions for a black tube: 
   * piece of shrink wrap (don't shrink it!)
   * the outer insulation from a multiconductor cable


Fritzing layout
