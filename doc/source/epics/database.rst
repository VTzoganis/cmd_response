EPICS database
##############

An EPICS database file is used to create specific record instances
that will be used by an IOC.  It declares them by defining the name
and EPICS record type.  The name can be fully declared, such as *time*
or can be completed later by expansion of a macro definition, such as 
*$(P)cmd*.  The value of the macro will be specified in the IOC 
startup script, either through a call to *dbLoadRecords()* or *dbLoadTemplate()*.

This file is written to be used by more than one IOC, so it uses
a common macro for the IOC prefix (*$(P)*).  In our example IOC,
we'll call this database file as (noting *P* is set to ``como:cr:``)::

  dbLoadRecords("$(CMD_RESPONSE)/cmd_response.db","P=como:cr:,PORT=usb0")

(More on this in the section titled: :ref:`IOC.commands`.)

temperature sensor
******************

It is easy to measure temperature so let's add that.
A thermistor varies its resistance with temperature.  
The temperature can be measured using a voltage divider circuit.

       Voltage divider circuit with the thermistor
       (:download:`thermistor.png`)

We'll connect the thermistor voltage signal, :math:`V_T`, 
to the Arduino's ANALOG IN A2 pin and the supply voltage, :math:`V_{cc}`,
to pin A3.  Having actual measurements of :math:`V_{cc}` will improve our
precision of temperature reporting.

For a 10 kOhm (:math:`R_{ref}=10\mbox{ kOhm}`) 
negative temperature coefficient thermistor, 
we'll use a 10 kOhm
resistor (:math:`R_4=10\mbox{ kOhm}`) to balance the voltage divider
so that its response is most sensitive at its reference temperatue (25 C).
We measure the thermistor voltage, :math:`V_T`, 
and calculate its resistance, :math:`R_T`:

.. math:: R_T = R_4 { V_T / V_{cc} \over 1 - V_T / V_{cc} }

The temperature, :math:`T`, is a non-linear function of  :math:`R_T`.  Taking
:math:`r=ln(R_T / R_{ref})` as a reduced resistance term to simplify the math,
we use the *extended â€œSteinhart and Hart"* interpolation ([#vishay]_):

.. math:: T = {1 \over A_1 + B_1 r + C_1 r^2 + D_1 r^3}

.. tip::  It's easier to do the computation in EPICS records 
   rather than the Arduino.

Using coefficients (Vishay thermistor, 10k NTC, :math:`\beta=3977\mbox{ K}`) 
from the manufacturer's data sheet [#vishay]_:

== =============
A1 3.354016E-03
B1 2.569850E-04
C1 2.620131E-06
D1 6.383091E-08
== =============

we can now compute a curve for the signal we expect to measure.
